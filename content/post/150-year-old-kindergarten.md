I remember my first day on the job, as a new caretaker. The goal was simple, to build rapport with the kids, and as we do so, they grow into mature adults and one day will contribute to society. My assignment was to work with a group of siblings. Fortunately, my seniors and the previous caretakers have left many notes behind to help the new hires. Unfortunately, this was no normal kindergarten, as the children are algebraic groups, mathematical structures humanity have a symbiotic relationship with. Many a mathematician worked here, for the last 150 years, passing their knowledge from generation to generation.

Every child has their own personality. For example, one of them, which we affectionately call the "Monster" due to its large size, was very reclusive when they first entered this kindergarten. Mathieu and Greiss were two of the caretakers which had found him, and he really only warmed up to us after Conway worked with him. We now understand their behaviour slightly better. In turn, this has profound implications to humanity, improving our understanding of Quantum Gravity, for example.

At work, I often see this pair of twins, named the Permanent and Determinant varieties. We try to understand how the twins interact with one another, with the hope that by understanding their interactions, we will be able to shed light on a central problem in Computer Science, which describes whether certain problems can have fast solutions.

There have been some children who have graduated, as they mature, alongside our deep understanding of their personalities. For instance, the brother and sister pair, the General and Special Linear Group. From what I've read, they were always very well-behaved and as they now left this home, they perform very important roles ranging from Statistics to Machine Learning. A close cousin of theirs, which had also graduated, the Special Orthogonal Group, serves at the heart of Quantum Physics and Signal Processing.

Now, I work with the younger siblings of a graduate, the Grassmannian, which we name the Richardson varieties. As they grew up in similar circumstances, reading the report of their older brother, the Grassmannian, helps me understand their personalities and quirks a little better. To aid in this task, my supervisor also handed me a report by Galashin and Lam, who managed to get a handle of these kids. They realised that these siblings (together with their brother) are part of the club of Cluster Algebras, whose membership requirements are very stringent, and known exceptionally well. By realising their presence in the club, we now know so much more of their mannerisms, giving us future caretakers a handle to work with the siblings. I hope to build a similar relationship as Galashin and Lam did. 

Everyday, there will be a new adventure, and I love working with these kids. I like it here, and I think I would like to keep working here.

This is post that was initally made as I took a module on scientific communication, and I always felt that I wanted to convey what I am doing. I think it a great pity, that I never had been able to explain to my parents of the work I do, and I hope that this conveys the motivation and emotions that drive me, rather than the technical content.

The result of [Galashin and Lam 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03501) can be found at this link. The name of the post references the origins of the field around 150 years ago.
